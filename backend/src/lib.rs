//! OpenEPL backend (Phase 2): typed IR -> textual LLVM IR (`.ll`), emitting the
//! real **slot ABI** calling convention (abi/openepl_abi.h).
//!
//! Every command is invoked as `void cmd(Slot* ret, i32 argc, Slot* argv)`
//!.  For each call the backend allocates an argv array of `%Slot`s and
//! a return slot, stores each argument's tag + reinterpreted 64-bit value, calls
//! the command by its runtime symbol (no dispatch table, no ordinal indirection
//! — G8), then reads the return slot back.  `clang` assembles + links this
//! against the static-linked command implementations (BlackMoon model, D1).
//!
//! `%Slot = { i32 tag, i32 pad, i64 value }` mirrors `OpenEPL_Slot` (16 bytes,
//! value at offset 8), enforced by `_Static_assert` on the C side.
//!
//! Assumes the module passed `openepl_ir::validate`.  Entry is `ECodeStart`.
