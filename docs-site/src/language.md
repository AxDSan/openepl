# Language guide

A whole program is one module. Files are UTF-8 and use the extension `.oir`;
`#` starts a comment that runs to the end of the line. This page is the
reference; [A tour of the language](./tour.md) is the same material met in the
order a newcomer meets it.

```
# A module is a compilation unit.
module hello
target console

sub main
  call print_text("Hello.")
end
```

## Modules

```
module <name>
target <kind>      # optional
use <library>      # optional, repeatable
```

`target` and `use` come first, then the module's contents. Leave `target` out
and OpenEPL infers it — a module with a form is a windowed program, anything
else is a console one. See [Build targets](./build-targets.md).

`use ui` brings in the visual components; without it, `form` and the visual
component types are not defined. `timer` needs no library — it is part of the
core runtime, and a console program can declare one.

## Types

| Type | Holds |
| --- | --- |
| `int` | a whole number |
| `int64` | a wider whole number |
| `double` | a number with a fractional part |
| `text` | UTF-8 text |
| `bool` | `true` or `false` |
| `T[]` | a list of `T` |
| `T{}` | a dictionary of `T`, found by text key |
| `bytes` | a run of raw bytes |
| a record | a group of named fields you declare yourself |

Types are written after a colon and are not inferred:

```
let count: int = 3
let ratio: double = 1.5
let name: text = "OpenEPL"
let ready: bool = true
```

There is no implicit conversion between them. Convert explicitly:

```
let n: int = 42
call print_text(concat("answer: ", int_to_text(n)))
```

## Groups of values

A list is written with `[]`, a dictionary with `{}`, and both count from 1 —
as does every other indexed thing in the language, so a loop runs `1` to the
count with no `- 1` anywhere.

```
var names: text[] = ["Ada", "Grace"]
names = append(names, "Alan")
call print_text(names[1])              # Ada

var ages: int{} = {"Ada": 36}
ages["Grace"] = 45
call print_int(ages["Ada"])
```

A dictionary holds one type of value. Asking for a key that is not there
answers that type's sentinel — `0`, `""`, `false` — and leaves the reason in
the error slot, so `dict_has` is what separates a missing key from a stored
`0`.

A `record` names a group of related values, and is the way a subroutine gives
back more than one thing:

```
record point
  x: int
  y: int
end

sub midpoint(a: point, b: point): point
  return point(x: (a.x + b.x) / 2, y: (a.y + b.y) / 2)
end
```

Fields are given by name when a record is built, and read and written with a
dot: `p.x`, `p.x = 5`. A record is a **reference**, exactly as a list is — two
names for one record are two names for the same fields — so passing one to a
subroutine does not copy it.

## Values that change, and values that do not

`let` binds a value that stays put. `var` binds one you intend to reassign.

```
let limit: int = 10       # reassigning this is an error
var total: int = 0
total = total + 5
```

The distinction is enforced: assigning to a `let` is a compile error that says
so, and names which fix to apply.

A `var` at module level is visible to every subroutine in the file — which is
how an event handler and the rest of the program share state:

```
module counters
target gui
use ui

var hits: int = 0

form main_window
  title = "Counter"
  width = 320
  height = 160

  button tap
    text = "Tap me"
    left = 40
    top = 40
    width = 160
    height = 40
    on click: on_tap
  end
end

sub on_tap
  hits = hits + 1
  tap.text = concat("tapped ", int_to_text(hits))
end
```

A module variable's initializer may call commands but may not read another
module variable — order-dependent start-up is a source of bugs that is easier
to forbid than to explain.

## Subroutines

```
sub name(parameter: type, ...): type
  ...
  return value
end
```

Both the parameter list and the return type are optional. A subroutine with
neither is an *entry point*: either `main`, or a subroutine bound to a
component's event. `main` is where a console program starts; in a windowed
program it runs before the window appears, if the module has one at all.

```
sub add(a: int, b: int): int
  return a + b
end
```

A parameter is declared the way a variable is — `name: type` — and is
immutable inside the body: assigning to one would make the call site's
argument a lie about what the subroutine is working with. Copy it into a `var`
if you need working state.

A subroutine that declares a return type must `return` a value of that type on
every path; a subroutine that declares none may `return` with no value to leave
early. An `if` without an `else` is not a complete path, and a `while` never
counts as one — it may not run at all.

You call a subroutine exactly as you call a command: as a statement with
`call`, or anywhere in an expression when it returns a value.

```
module greeting

sub shout(who: text): text
  return concat(uppercase(who), "!")
end

sub main
  call print_text(shout("ada"))
end
```

`call` has one other form. `call through <pointer>(args): type` calls a
function whose *address* a program is holding — what a plug-in loader or a COM
vtable hands back — rather than one it can name; the call site carries the
signature, because there is no declaration to carry it. It belongs with the
rest of the foreign-function machinery, so it is described in [Calling a
function pointer](./interop.md#calling-a-function-pointer).

Commands and subroutines share one namespace, so a subroutine may not take a
library command's name — that would silently change what every existing call
in the file means, and the compiler says so instead.

A subroutine may call itself. Recursion needs no forward declaration:

```
module fibonacci

sub fib(n: int): int
  if n < 2
    return n
  end
  return fib(n - 1) + fib(n - 2)
end

sub main
  call print_int(fib(15))
end
```

An entry point and an event handler are the one place the shape is fixed by
someone other than you. `main` takes nothing and returns nothing — the runtime
that calls it has nothing to hand over. A subroutine bound to an event takes
exactly what the event hands it, or nothing at all, and returns nothing: a
`timer`'s `tick` hands the tick count, so its handler is `sub on_tick(n: int)`
or plain `sub on_tick`, and `sub on_tick(s: text)` is a compile error that
shows the header to paste. See [Components](./components.md).

## When a command fails

There are no exceptions. A command that can fail returns a sentinel — `0` for
a handle or a position, `-1` for a count or size, `""` for text, `false` for a
yes/no — and leaves the reason in the *error slot*, which `last_error_code()`
and `last_error_text()` read.

```
module missing
use file

sub main
  let notes: text = file_read_text("notes.txt")
  if last_error_code() <> 0
    call print_text(concat("could not read notes.txt: ", last_error_text()))
    return
  end
  call print_text(notes)
end
```

A command that succeeds clears the slot, and a command that cannot fail never
touches it, so a code left over from earlier is never mistaken for a fresh
failure. That is what makes `false` and `0` readable: `false` with code `0`
is a genuine no, and `0` from `find` means *not there* — nothing sits at
position 0. [A tour of the language](./tour.md) walks through this with a
program that grows.

## Expressions

Arithmetic is `+ - * / %` with the usual precedence, and parentheses group.
`%` is the remainder, and a leading `-` negates.

```
let x: int = 2 + 3 * 4        # 14
let y: int = (2 + 3) * 4      # 20
let r: int = 17 % 5           # 2
let below: int = -40          # negation, on literals and on expressions
```

Both sides of an arithmetic operator must be the same type: there is no
implicit conversion, so `d + 1` where `d` is a `double` is an error. Write
`d + int_to_double(1)`.

Dividing an integer by zero stops the program with a message on stderr rather
than killing it silently.

`+` on two `text` values joins them — the same thing the `concat` command
does, spelled so that building a sentence does not nest.

```
call print_text("Hello, " + who + " — you are " + int_to_text(age) + " today.")
```

Comparisons produce a `bool`: `=` `<>` `<` `<=` `>` `>=`. Combine them with
`and`, `or` and `not`.

```
let in_range: bool = count >= 1 and count <= 10
let missing: bool = not found
```

`=` compares. Assignment is a statement, never an expression, so `if x = 5`
tests whether `x` is five — it cannot assign by accident.

A command that returns a value can be used anywhere a value fits:

```
let longest: int = max_int(length(first), length(second))
```

See [Commands](./reference-commands.md) for the full list.

## Bitwise operators and hex literals

A flag word, a mask, a packed pair of 16-bit halves — these are values whose
*bits* matter rather than their size. OpenEPL writes them the way their
documentation does, and operates on them with words.

### Writing a bit pattern

A number may be written in hexadecimal with `0x` or in binary with `0b`, and
`_` may be put anywhere in the digits to group them.

```
let mask: int = 0xFF          # 255
let bits: int = 0b1010        # 10
let magic: int = 0xDEAD_BEEF
```

**A hex or binary literal is a bit pattern, and how wide it is comes from
where it lands.** On its own, a pattern of 32 bits or fewer is an `int`
holding exactly those bits — so `0x8000_0000` is `-2147483648` and
`0xFFFF_FFFF` is `-1`, which is what a mask written for a 32-bit word means.
A pattern that needs more than 32 bits is an `int64` holding exactly those
bits. Where an `int64` is wanted, the same pattern is those bits in 64,
gaining zeros rather than a sign:

```
const HKEY_CURRENT_USER = 0x8000_0001

let as_int: int = HKEY_CURRENT_USER        # -2147483647
var as_wide: int64 = HKEY_CURRENT_USER     # 2147483649
```

Both readings are the same 32 bits; which one a program gets is decided by
the type it is being read into, so a `DWORD` constant is right in an `int`
mask and right again in an `int64` parameter without being written twice.

How wide the pattern is comes from its *value*, not from how many digits were
typed: leading zeros change nothing, so `0x0000_0000_DEAD_BEEF` is the same
pattern as `0xDEAD_BEEF`. The way to the 64-bit reading is the destination —
`var v: int64 = 0xDEAD_BEEF` is 3735928559.

A leading `-` says the pattern was meant as a magnitude after all, so `-0x10`
is simply `-16`. More than 64 bits, a digit the base does not have, or no
digits at all is an error at the literal.

Decimal is unchanged: `2147483648` is an `int64`, because it is a *number*
and that number does not fit an `int`.

### The operators

| Written | Does | On |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `a band b` | bits set in both | `int`, `int64` |
| `a bor b` | bits set in either | `int`, `int64` |
| `a bxor b` | bits set in one but not both | `int`, `int64` |
| `bnot a` | every bit flipped | `int`, `int64` |
| `a shl n` | shift left by `n` | `int`, `int64` |
| `a shr n` | shift right, keeping the sign | `int`, `int64` |
| `a ushr n` | shift right, filling with zeros | `int`, `int64` |

They are defined on `int` and `int64` and on nothing else. A `double`'s bits
are an IEEE encoding, so `and`-ing two of them is never what was meant;
`bool`, `text` and `ptr` have no bits a program addresses one at a time. Any
of those is an error naming the operator and the side it was on.

`bnot` is the bitwise partner of `not`: `not` answers a truth value, `bnot`
flips bits.

```
let combined: int = WS_VISIBLE bor WS_POPUP     # flags together
let cleared: int = flags band bnot WS_BORDER    # one flag taken away
let low: int64 = wparam band 0xFFFF             # the low half of a WPARAM
let high: int64 = wparam ushr 16 band 0xFFFF    # the high half
```

`shr` keeps the sign and `ushr` does not: `-16 shr 2` is `-4`, and
`-16 ushr 2` is `1073741820`. A value used as a bit pattern rather than as a
number wants `ushr`.

### Precedence

Tightest at the top. A bitwise operator binds **looser** than a comparison,
which is what lets a flag test be written without parentheses — the one place
this table deliberately differs from C's.

| | |
| --- | --- |
| `xs[i]`, `r.field` | postfix |
| `-a`, `bnot a` | unary |
| `* / %` | |
| `+ -` | |
| `shl` `shr` `ushr` | |
| `band` | |
| `bxor` | |
| `bor` | |
| `= <> < <= > >=` | comparison, and not chainable |
| `not` | |
| `and` | |
| `or` | loosest |

```
if style band WS_VISIBLE <> 0        # (style band WS_VISIBLE) <> 0
let x: int = 1 shl 4 band 0xFF       # (1 shl 4) band 0xFF        -> 16
let y: int = 1 shl 2 + 2             # 1 shl (2 + 2)              -> 16
let z: int = 1 bor 6 band 4          # 1 bor (6 band 4)           -> 5
```

### The rules the checker holds you to

**Both sides of `band`, `bor` and `bxor` must be the same width.** A literal
takes the width of what it meets, so `wparam band 0xFFFF` works with an
`int64` `wparam`; an `int` *variable* does not, because that would be the
implicit conversion the language does not have. Write
`a band int_to_int64(b)`, and the message says so.

**A shift's count is a count**, not a second value: it may be an `int` or an
`int64` whatever the value's type is, and the result is the value's type. A
count written down must be within the value's width — `1 shl 32` on an `int`
is refused at build time, because there is no answer to give. A count only
known at run time is taken modulo that width.

**The infix operator words are soft keywords.** `band`, `bor`, `bxor`, `shl`,
`shr` and `ushr` mean the operator only where an operator can go — after a
complete value, where a name could never have appeared. A variable, a
parameter or a field named for one keeps working:

```
var band: int = 7
call print_int(band + 1)      # 8 — `band` here is a name
var shl: int = 7
call print_int(shl shl 2)     # 28 — a name, the operator, a number
```

`bnot` is the exception: it is a **reserved word**, like `not`. A prefix
operator cannot be soft — `bnot(x)` reads as the operator and as a call to
something named `bnot` equally well, and `bnot - 1` as a complement and as a
subtraction. Guessing there gives a wrong answer rather than an error, so the
word is refused as a name at the line that writes it.

## Choosing

```
if temperature > 30
  call print_text("hot")
else if temperature > 15
  call print_text("mild")
else
  call print_text("cold")
end
```

The condition must be a `bool`. There is no truthiness — an `int` is not a
condition, and saying so is a compile error rather than a surprise.

## Repeating

`while` repeats for as long as its condition holds.

```
var i: int = 0
while i < 3
  call print_int(i)
  i = i + 1
end
```

`for` counts. The loop variable is an `int` that belongs to the loop and
cannot be assigned to inside it; `step` counts by something other than one,
and a negative step counts down.

```
for n = 1 to 10
  call print_int(n)
end

for n = 10 to 1 step -2
  call print_int(n)
end
```

The start and the limit are read **once**, before the first turn, so a loop
cannot be lengthened by its own body. `step` is a whole-number literal, which
is what lets the compiler know whether the loop counts up or down.

`break` leaves the innermost loop; `continue` goes straight to its next turn.
Both work in a `while` and in a `for`.

```
for n = 101 to 200
  if n % 7 <> 0
    continue
  end
  call print_int(n)     # the first multiple of 7 above 100
  break
end
```

Local variables are visible for the whole subroutine, so two loops in one
subroutine need two different loop-variable names.

## Components

A component's properties are read and written with a dot:

```
greeting.text = "Ready."
button_ok.width = 200
```

Which properties exist depends on the component; the compiler checks both the
name and the type, so a typo is an error at build time rather than a control
that silently does nothing. See [Forms and events](./forms-and-events.md) for
the shape of a form, and [Components](./components.md) for what the
components are and what their events hand a handler.
