/* Five bit operations, one shape: (int, int) -> int.
 *
 * A uniform signature is what makes a table of these callable in a loop — the
 * program picks a slot and calls it, and every slot means the same prototype.
 * Each function is C's own operator, so an OpenEPL program that computes the
 * same thing with `band`, `bor`, `bxor`, `shl` and `ushr` has something real to
 * check itself against.
 *
 * The shifts go through `unsigned` because a signed left shift that runs off
 * the top, and a signed right shift, are C's business rather than the
 * machine's; the cast pins them to the wrap and the zero-fill that OpenEPL's
 * `shl` and `ushr` do.
