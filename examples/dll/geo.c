/* A tiny C library for the c-struct record tests: a real C struct passed by
 * pointer across the `dll` boundary and mutated in place.
 *
 * `Point` is the C side of an OpenEPL `record Point is c (x: int, y: int)` —
 * two `int`s, natural layout, `sizeof` 8. `move_point` takes a pointer to one
 * and shifts it, the plainest proof that OpenEPL handed C the address of a real
 * struct: C reads and writes the same bytes OpenEPL laid out.
 *
 * `Mixed` matches `record Mixed is c (a: byte, b: int, c: byte, d: int64)`.
 * The reference helpers report what this C compiler computes for its size and
 * field offsets, so the test can hold OpenEPL's own layout to clang's. */
