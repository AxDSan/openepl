/* A tiny C library that calls BACK into its caller through a function pointer —
 * the other half of `dll`. `dll` lets OpenEPL call C; this lets C call OpenEPL,
 * which is what every hook, thread entry and enumeration callback needs.
 *
 * Built to `libcb.so` (or `cb.dll` for the Windows case) beside the program
 * that passes it a subroutine's address. Three shapes cover the ground: a
 * function pointer that returns a value (`apply`), one called for its side
 * effect several times over (`each`), and one handed a C string (`greet`) to
 * prove a `text` parameter survives the crossing. `each` counts from 1,
 * matching how the program's own loop would, so the printed sequence reads the
 * obvious way.
