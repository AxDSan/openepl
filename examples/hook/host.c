/* The host for the hook example: an ordinary program that calls a function,
 * then loads the OpenEPL library and calls the same function again.
 *
 * It links `hookrt` and calls `hookrt_call` directly — it is the "application"
 * whose function gets hooked. Loading `libhook.so` / `hook.dll` fires that
 * library's `dll_attach`, which installs a detour into the hookrt slot this
 * program is already using. So the second call returns a different value, in
 * this one process, with nothing patched by hand: the before/after is the hook.
 *
 * Build (Linux):
 *   clang -shared -fPIC examples/hook/hookrt.c -o libhookrt.so
 *   openepl build examples/hook/hook.oir --target sharedlib -o libhook.so
 *   clang examples/hook/host.c -L. -lhookrt -Wl,-rpath,. -ldl -o host
 *   ./host            # prints "before 20" then "after 21"
