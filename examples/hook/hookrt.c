/* A function-pointer detour runtime — the portable core of what a hooking
 * library like Detours does by rewriting a function's first bytes.
 *
 * Built to `libhookrt.so` (or `hookrt.dll`). It stands in for "the application"
 * in the worked hook: it owns a function everyone calls through a slot, and the
 * install call that redirects that slot. The OpenEPL library (`hook.oir`) reaches
 * these three exports through `dll` declarations; the host program links this
 * library and makes the calls. Because there is one copy of the slot in the one
 * loaded `libhookrt`, a detour the OpenEPL library installs is seen by the host —
 * which is the whole point of an in-process hook.
