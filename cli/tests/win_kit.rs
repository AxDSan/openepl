//! The `win` kit, whole: `use win` and nothing else, held to what Windows
//! actually does.
//!
//! The five subsystem suites beside this one (`win_user32`, `win_gdi32`,
//! `win_kernel32_proc`, `win_kernel32_mem`, `win_advapi32`) each prove one
//! `.oed` file against a scratch kit holding only that file. This one proves
//! the opposite thing: that the five files merge into a single bundle with no
//! name fighting another, that `use win` resolves it, and — the part that
//! decides whether the kit is finished — that a real Windows program can be
//! written with `use win` as its only foreign declaration.
//!
//! `examples/win/` is that program, five times over. Not one of those files
//! contains a `dll`, a `record ... is c` or a `const` line: every struct,
//! every number and every entry point comes from the kit. If the kit were
//! short of anything they need, they would not build.
//!
//! They are cross-built with mingw and run under wine, because a Win32
//! binding cannot be proved by parsing it. A struct field at the wrong
//! offset, a `DWORD` declared `int64`, an entry point spelled the way the
//! documentation prints it rather than the way the DLL exports it — none of
//! those fail a build, and all of them fail the moment Windows fills a struct
//! or dispatches a message.
//!
//! ## The display
//!
//! wine is run with `DISPLAY` and `WAYLAND_DISPLAY` removed from the
//! environment, so it falls back to its null display driver. Two consequences,
//! and both matter:
//!
//! * Nothing appears on the screen of whoever is working on this machine. A
//!   test must never steal a window or a focus.
//! * A window is still *created* and its messages are still *delivered* — the
//!   null driver is a driver. `window.oir` registers a class, creates a
//!   window, pumps messages, and its WNDPROC is called back with WM_PAINT and
//!   WM_DESTROY, all of which this suite checks. What is not checked, because
//!   there is no framebuffer to read, is that the pixels TextOutA drew are the
//!   pixels intended.
//!
//! Every test says why it is skipping when the cross compiler or wine is not
//! installed, so a green run on a machine without them is not mistaken for
//! proof.
