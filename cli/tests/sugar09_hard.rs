//! End-to-end tests for the 0.9.0 hard tier: the optional type `T?`, the list
//! built by a loop, and `defer`.
//!
//! All three are rewrites into what the language already had — a value with a
//! hidden truth beside it, a `for each` with an `append` in it, the cleanup
//! statement written out at each exit — so the tests prove the OUTPUT, and the
//! output is a *sequence*. A `defer` that runs, but after the value it was
//! meant to run behind, and an optional that unwraps to a stale error slot both
//! type-check perfectly; only the order the program prints in catches them.
