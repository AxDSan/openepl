//! Bitwise operators and hex/binary literals, end to end.
//!
//! The two halves arrived together because they are one gap: before this, a
//! flag word could only be combined with `+` (which is wrong the moment a flag
//! is set twice), a flag could not be *tested* at all, LOWORD and HIWORD were
//! division tricks, and every one of the win kit's ~880 constants was a
//! decimal with the hex in a comment beside it.
//!
//! `examples/bitwise.oir` is a self-checking transcript: every line prints `ok`
//! or `FAIL`. The tests below run it and then pin the handful of answers that
//! would be silently wrong rather than loudly wrong if a rule slipped — the
//! width of a literal, the sign of a shift, the precedence of a flag test —
//! plus the diagnostics for the operands these operators do not have.
