//! End-to-end tests for `call through` — calling a function whose address is
//! only known at run time.
//!
//! A `dll` line names a symbol the linker resolves. This is the other half: the
//! program is holding a `ptr` that a loader handed back, and the call site
//! supplies the C signature the declaration would otherwise have carried. It is
//! what makes `GetProcAddress` and `dlsym` useful — before it, both returned an
//! address nothing in the language could call — and it is the single operation
//! a COM vtable is made of.
//!
//! The library under test is `examples/dll/plug.c`, built as `libplug.so` here
//! and as `plug.dll` for the Windows case. Neither program links against it and
//! neither declares a single one of its functions.
