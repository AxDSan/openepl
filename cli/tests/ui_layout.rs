//! Layout and validation in the `ui` library, end to end in built binaries:
//! anchors that follow a resize, colours refused before the substrate sees
//! them, and where a form's window opens.
//!
//! Everything runs headless through the UI test hooks (abi/openepl_ui.h):
//! `OPENEPL_UI_SIZE` stands in for a window manager's resize, and
//! `OPENEPL_UI_DEBUG` prints the rectangle each anchored control was moved
//! to — by widget handle, because component identifiers never reach the
//! binary (G8). The form is handle 1 and its children follow in declaration
//! order.
