//! End-to-end tests for the 0.9.0 literal and slicing sugar: block strings
//! (`"""..."""`), raw strings (`r"..."`), the collection literals, and the
//! slice `xs[a..b]`.
//!
//! Every one of these is a *rewrite* into something the language already had —
//! a block string is a text literal whose newlines were typed rather than
//! escaped, a raw string is one with no escape pass at all, `[a, b, c]` is
//! build-then-fill, and a slice is the `substr` / `slice` / `bytes_slice`
//! command the base's type answers to. So the tests prove the OUTPUT, byte for
//! byte: sugar that type-checks and computes the wrong thing is the failure
//! that matters. Positions count from 1 and a slice includes both ends, so the
//! expected values are spelled out rather than computed.
