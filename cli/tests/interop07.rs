//! The two halves of 0.7.0, proved together.
//!
//! `call through` calls an address; `band`, `bor`, `bxor`, `shl` and `ushr`
//! work on the bits of a word, and a hex literal writes one down. Each has its
//! own tests — `indirect.rs` and `bitwise.rs`. This file is the join, because
//! the reason both arrived at once is that neither is much use alone: an
//! address is chosen out of a table by testing a bit, and the flag word handed
//! to the function that address belongs to is built by combining constants.
//!
//! Two programs, one per platform, and both are self-checking transcripts:
//!
//! * `examples/dll/dispatch.oir` opens `libops.so` (from `examples/dll/ops.c`),
//!   which is neither linked against nor declared, fetches five same-shaped
//!   exports into a `ptr[5]`, and lets a request word decide which to call —
//!   then checks C's `&`, `|`, `^`, `<<` and `>>` against OpenEPL's own.
//! * `examples/win/flags.oir` asks `GetProcAddress` for `GetCurrentProcessId`
//!   and calls it, checking the answer against the same function reached as a
//!   declared import, and combines and tests the `win` kit's real constants —
//!   including handing `VirtualAlloc` and `OpenProcess` words built with `bor`.
