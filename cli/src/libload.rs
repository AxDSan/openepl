//! Build-time kit introspection.
//!
//! For the implicit `core` library and each `use <name>`, the loader:
//!   1. builds an introspection shared object from the library's sources
//!      (impls + the `*_libinfo.c` metadata TU, minus the program entry),
//!   2. `dlopen`s it and calls `openepl_get_lib_info` to read the `LibInfo`
//!      metadata, populating a `Registry` (the authoritative signatures — no
//!      hard-coded Rust table), and
//!   3. records the library's *implementation* sources (everything except the
//!      `*_libinfo.c` metadata TU) for static-linking into the program.
//!
//! The metadata TU never enters the program link line, preserving `--gc-sections`
//! dead-stripping.
//!
//! `dlopen` runs the target library in-process, so this native path assumes
//! host == target (x86_64-linux). Cross-compilation needs a sidecar manifest
//! instead (Phase 4).
