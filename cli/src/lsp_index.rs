//! A token-level symbol index for the language server.
//!
//! Deliberately built from the **lexer**, not the AST. While you are typing, a
//! file usually does not parse but almost always lexes — and go-to-definition,
//! completion and hover have to keep working in exactly that state. An
//! AST-derived index would go dark at the moment it is most needed.
//!
//! This is sound for OpenEPL v0.3 because the validator already enforces a
//! single module-level namespace: a name cannot be both a subroutine and a
//! module variable and a component id. The one genuine ambiguity is **local
//! shadowing** — a `let x` inside a subroutine must not resolve to a module
//! `var x` — so declarations are tracked per enclosing subroutine.
