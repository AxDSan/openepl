//! Reads the debug information an OpenEPL build emits.
//!
//! This crate knows how to *read* a built program: which address belongs to
//! which line of which source, and which function an address is in. It never
//! runs anything — there is no `ptrace` here, no child process, nothing that
//! needs a program to be running. That separation is deliberate, and it is the
//! lesson every from-scratch debugger reports learning late: the code that
//! understands debug information is long-lived and worth testing on its own,
//! and the code that drives a process is neither.
//!
//! Nothing here shells out to `gdb` or `lldb`, and nothing here requires
//! either to be installed. `gimli` parses DWARF and `object` parses the
//! container; everything above them is ours.
