# The OpenEPL debugger

**Status:** Phase 0 shipped in 0.10.1. Phases 1 and 2 done. Phases 3–8 planned.

OpenEPL ships its own debugger. Not a wrapper around gdb or lldb, and not a
dependency on either being installed — the bundle's promise is "unpack and
run, nothing to install", and a debugger that needs a system debugger breaks
it. Every layer below is ours.

This is what the research settled and what it left open. It was written after
surveying Lazarus/FpDebug (a RAD IDE that wrote its own DWARF debugger in its
own language and migrated *off* gdb — the closest analogue to this), Delve
(a from-scratch native debugger for one language), the Debug Adapter
Protocol, LLVM's textual debug metadata, and how Visual Studio, Delphi,
Qt Creator and JetBrains architect theirs.

## The shape

Three layers, and the middle one is where "ours" lives.

1. **Debug info from the backend.** `backend/src/lib.rs` emits LLVM IR as
   *text*, so `-g` on clang buys nothing: the metadata has to be written into
   the IR by hand. `!DICompileUnit`, `!DIFile`, `!DISubprogram` per sub,
   `!DILocation` on every instruction from `Stmt.line`, `!DILocalVariable` +
   `#dbg_declare` on the alloca slots. This layer is needed whatever sits on
   top of it.
2. **`openepl debug`** — a Rust binary speaking **DAP over stdio**, backed by
   a new `openepl-debug` crate: ptrace for process control, `gimli` for DWARF
   and CFI, `object` for ELF. This is the house shape (the CLI does the work,
   Studio drives it as a subprocess) and it is `lspclient.h` again. It owns
   the *OpenEPL* model: arrays shown 1-based, `text` rendered as characters,
   records with real field names, runtime frames filtered out of a backtrace,
   step-over that does not descend into `print_text`. DAP also means the VS
   Code extension gets debugging for free — one server, many editors.
3. **Studio.** Gutter breakpoints, a stopped-line tint, step/continue on the
   toolbar, Variables and Call Stack panes beside PROBLEMS.

## Why our own engine, concretely

Owning the engine is what buys the RAD tier, and the RAD tier is the point:
breaking inside an `on_click` handler and seeing both your variables *and*
the form's component state. A `.debug_openepl` sidecar section carries the
component → handle map, so Studio can show a Components scope beside Locals
and offer "break when this button is clicked". Classic 易语言 never reached
that tier — its own community's defect list records only single-step, watch,
debug statements and breakpoints.

## Phases

Each ships alone and names the command that proves it.

| # | What | Proven by |
|---|---|---|
| 0 | **Hoist the inline allocas** — done, 0.10.1 | a million command calls in a loop exits 0 |
| 1 | **A line table — done** | `objdump --dwarf=decodedline` lists a row per statement, and gdb breaks on `loops.oir:24`, shows the source, and backtraces |
| 2 | **The symbol layer — done.** `openepl-debug`, a 4th workspace member | the engine's line table is identical to objdump's, row for row |
| 3 | Unwinding via gimli's CFI evaluator, unit-tested on synthetic registers | `cargo test -p openepl-debug` |
| 4 | Launch, int3 breakpoints, stepping, backtrace | `openepl debug --batch 'break x.oir:5; run; where; next'` |
| 5 | Locals, rendered in OpenEPL's value model | `locals` prints `nums = [1, 2, 3]` (1-based), `p = Point { x: 1 }` |
| 6 | DAP, and VS Code for free | `cli/tests/dap.rs` drives the full handshake |
| 7 | Studio: gutter, stopped line, panes | a scripted session plus a rendered frame, per CLAUDE.md |
| 8 | The RAD wins: component state at a breakpoint, break-on-click | a click drives a stop with the button's caption shown |

Phase 2 before Phase 4 is FpDebug's ordering lesson taken literally: they read
debug info for a year before controlling a process, and their DWARF parsers
are the least-churned code in their tree while stepping took 465 commits.

## What Phase 1 actually did

`backend/src/debug.rs` builds the metadata block; `Body` — a `fmt::Write`
wrapper around what used to be a `String` — attaches `!dbg` to every
instruction with **no change to the 198 places that write one**. Only user
subroutines carry debug information; the synthesised functions (entry point,
library initialiser, export wrappers, event thunks) deliberately carry none,
which is what makes the verifier's "a call in a function with debug info must
have a location" rule a non-event rather than the day-one blocker it was
predicted to be.

Two things had to be given locations that have no statement behind them: the
prologue's `alloca`s and the closing `ret`. An instruction with no location
makes a line-table row with **no line**, and a debugger stepping into one shows
no source — so the prologue is attributed to the `sub` header and the tail to
the last statement. This was caught by asserting no row has line 0, not by
reading the IR.

Stock gdb is used as an *oracle*, never as a dependency: if gdb cannot see our
lines, nothing we write will either.

```
Breakpoint 1, oe_user_main () at examples/loops.oir:24
24	  call print_text("-- fizzbuzz, counted --")
#0  oe_user_main () at examples/loops.oir:24
#1  0x0000000000400c36 in ECodeStart ()
#2  0x000000000040168c in main ()
```

The Windows cross-build carries DWARF in PE too, unchanged — so Phase 2's
symbol layer can read both from the start.

## What Phase 2 actually did

`debug/` is a new workspace member, `openepl-debug`. It loads a built program
with `object`, reads the line program with `gimli`, and indexes it both ways:
address → line, and line → the address a breakpoint goes at. It runs nothing;
there is no `ptrace` in it. Seven transitive dependencies, all MIT-compatible.

`openepl debug --dump-lines / --dump-subs / --resolve / --at` exercises it.

Two things the first attempt got wrong, both found by comparing against an
oracle rather than by reading the code:

- **Other people's compile units.** Every binary built here links glibc's
  `atexit.c`, *with its debug information*. Merging its rows into the table
  attributed `atexit.c`'s line 45 to the user's source. Units are now filtered
  by `DW_AT_producer`, which the backend writes — so the user-frame filter is
  explicit, as the critique demanded, rather than a side effect of where
  unwinding happens to stop.
- **`LineTablesOnly` emits no `DW_TAG_subprogram` DIEs.** Function extents
  come from the ELF symbol table instead, keyed on the `oe_user_` prefix. That
  is enough for "which function is this address in", and it is stripped by
  `--release` on exactly the same terms as the line table.

`--resolve loops.oir:24` returns `0x400557` — the same address gdb picks for
`break loops.oir:24`, arrived at independently.

## Decisions taken

- **Debug info is on by default; `--release` strips it.** One emission path,
  so Studio's Run is debuggable without a mode switch — what every other
  compiler does.
- **No 198-site edit.** `self.body` becomes a wrapper implementing
  `fmt::Write` that appends `, !dbg !N` to indented instruction lines when a
  location is set. Labels are left alone. The five sites that assemble whole
  function bodies with `format!` (`:243`, `:247`, `:264`, `:737`, `:3971`)
  bypass it and need a fallback location, or LLVM's verifier discards the
  module's debug info wholesale.
- **Fail the build on `ignoring invalid debug info`.** Verified: `-w` and
  `-Wno-everything` do not suppress it, and clang exits 0 while producing no
  `.debug_*` sections at all. Without the check, every emitter bug looks like
  "the debugger sees nothing".
- **CFI is the primary unwinder**, frame pointers an optimisation — not the
  reverse. A naive rbp walk silently drops `main` when stopped at `low_pc`.
  Always break at `prologue_end`, never `low_pc`.

## Traps the critique found, to fold in before writing Phase 1

Each is a silent-failure class — wrong without an error message.

- **CFA direction.** The stack grows down, so a callee's CFA is *smaller*.
  `stepIn` is `frame.cfa < stopped.cfa`; `stepOut` is `>`; `next` is `==`.
  Get it backwards and stepIn silently degenerates into continue.
- **Leaving the topmost user frame means continue, not stop.** A click
  handler sits under 8–12 non-user frames across three languages. RmlUi is
  built `Release` with no `-g`, so a return-address breakpoint there has
  nothing to map to; the runtime *will* have a line table, so a user pressing
  `next` would start stepping OpenEPL's own event loop.
- **`.eh_frame` per mapped module.** SDL2 links shared (`-lSDL2`; there is no
  `libSDL2.a`), so pausing an idle form app stops inside `libSDL2.so` and a
  single-module unwinder yields a one-frame stack.
- **Stop all threads on any thread's stop.** `PTRACE_O_TRACECLONE` makes
  siblings traced; it does not stop them. Reading locals while another thread
  mutates them is a torn value, and DAP's `allThreadsStopped: true` would be
  a lie.
- **Globals need `!DIGlobalVariableExpression` and a `globals:` field** on the
  compile unit, or module variables are unreadable however good the engine is.
- **Record locals are two different shapes.** A heap record's alloca holds a
  `ptr`, so its `DILocalVariable` type is a `DW_TAG_pointer_type` *to* the
  composite; a c-record is a flat `[N x i8]` alloca, so the bare composite is
  correct. One sentence covering both renders garbage for one of them.
- **`launch` is a three-state machine**, not two: build, then stream clang's
  output as `output` events, then trace. A DAP adapter that blocks silently
  through a multi-second compile looks hung.

## Not doing

Windows process control (the `Target` trait is the seam that keeps the door
open), optimised-code debugging, watchpoints, and edit-and-continue.
