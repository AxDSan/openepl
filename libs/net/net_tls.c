/* TLS for the HTTP client, on mbedTLS, compiled only when mbedTLS is vendored.
 *
 * The whole file is one `#ifdef OPENEPL_NET_TLS`, and the macro comes from
 * `optional_requires` in lib.json matching the archives tools/fetch-mbedtls.sh
 * builds.  Nobody has to fetch it: without it this translation unit is the
 * three stubs at the bottom, `net_tls_available()` answers 0, and net_cmds.c
 * refuses https rather than downgrading it.
 *
 * Two rules govern everything here, and neither is negotiable:
 *
 *   Certificates are verified, always.  An https client that skips
 *   verification offers the appearance of security and none of it — anyone on
 *   the path can present their own certificate and read the traffic — which is
 *   worse than the honest refusal it replaced, because the refusal is visible
 *   and this is not.  So the authmode is REQUIRED, the hostname is set (which
 *   is both SNI and the name the certificate is checked against), and a
 *   handshake that cannot be verified fails.
 *
 *   No CA store means no connection.  Falling back to "trust everything"
 *   when the trust store cannot be found is the same hole arriving by a
 *   different door, so a machine with no bundle gets OE_ERR_UNSUPPORTED and a
 *   message naming OPENEPL_CA_BUNDLE.
