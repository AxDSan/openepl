/* Accessibility model — the thread boundary (ADR 0007).
 *
 * AccessKit's adapter states plainly in its own header: *"All of the handlers
 * will always be called from another thread."* RmlUi is not thread-safe, so an
 * adapter callback must never touch a widget. This model is the barrier: the
 * main thread publishes a mutex-guarded snapshot of the widget tree, and the
 * adapter thread only ever reads that.
 *
 * It also holds the D10 line: no substrate types here, and no AccessKit types
 * either, so `a11y_accesskit.cpp` and `ui_rmlui.cpp` never need to see each
 * other's headers.
