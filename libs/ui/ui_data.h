/* The rows behind a grid, and the datasource that can hold them instead.
 *
 * Plain C with no substrate in it, so a datasource is a thing a program can
 * fill from `main` before a window exists, and so a later `database` kit can
 * hand a query result to one without knowing what will draw it.  The RmlUi
 * backend reads tables through this header and never writes them; the writes
 * come from the form's properties and from the `grid_*` / `datasource_*`
 * commands, and a change counter is how the backend learns something moved.
 *
 * A table is rows of text cells with an optional header.  The program sees it
 * as ONE text — a newline between rows, a tab between cells — because a
 * component property value is a literal and a bare component id is not an
 * expression (see ui_libinfo.c), so that text is the only shape a form and a
 * running subroutine can both write.  A cell can therefore hold neither a tab
 * nor a newline; there is deliberately no escaping, because an escape the
 * inspector shows and the program has to spell is worse than a stated limit.
