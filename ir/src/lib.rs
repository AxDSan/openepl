//! OpenEPL e-code IR — v0.1 (Phase 1).
//!
//! The keystone artifact: a typed, tree-structured IR.  Phase 1 grows
//! the v0 slice with `int64`/`double` slot types, **command return types** and
//! **call-expressions** (so core commands are usable inside expressions), a
//! shared **command registry** (`registry`), a reusable **type checker**
//! (`sema`), and an **IR validator** (`validate`.1).
//!
//! The schema still reserves room for the form / component / property / event
//! nodes that later phases add (see `Item`).  Byte-set (`SDT_BIN`) and the
//! aggregate storage ABI are specified but deferred to Phase 2 (they ride on the
//! runtime↔library notification channel / memory-ownership model.2/D4).
//!
//! Only the *text* encoding is implemented; the binary encoding stays deferred.
