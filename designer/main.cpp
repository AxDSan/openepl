/* OpenEPL Studio — the visual designer.
 *
 * Chrome follows the OpenEPL Studio design specification: title bar, menu bar,
 * action toolbar, toolbox / designer / inspector docks, a split code+output
 * panel, and a status bar. Tokens live in theme.h so no colour is hard-coded
 * here.
 *
 * Dogfoods RmlUi: the IDE and the apps it builds run on the same
 * substrate, and the canvas builds components through the SHARED mapping
 * (libs/ui/ui_mapping.h) so what you draw is what you get (D9).
 *
 * It never parses .oir — `openepl inspect` is the only reader — and saving
 * splices the regenerated form over the original lines so hand-written code
 * survives.
