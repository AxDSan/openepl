/* OpenEPL Studio's settings: the schema, and the file it lives in.
 *
 * Two rules shape this file.
 *
 * **Every setting does something.** The menu bar's rule — "an entry that only
 * prints 'not implemented' is worse than no entry at all" — applies with more
 * force here, because a control that persists a value nothing reads looks
 * exactly like one that works. Each row below names the code it changes. A
 * setting whose mechanism does not exist yet is not listed greyed out; it is
 * not listed.
 *
 * **The schema is the single source.** The file format, the defaults, the
 * dialog's rows and its categories are all generated from `schema()`, so
 * adding a setting is one row here plus the code that reads it. There is no
 * second list to forget.
 *
 * The file is `key: value` lines in the user's data directory, the same shape
 * as `project.oeproj`, `template.meta` and the recent list — one format for
 * everything a person might open in an editor. Unknown keys are preserved on
 * save: a settings file written by a newer Studio must survive being opened by
 * an older one.
