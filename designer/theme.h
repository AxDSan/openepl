/* OpenEPL Studio design tokens.
 *
 * From the OpenEPL Studio design specification. Kept in one place so the chrome
 * never hard-codes a colour: changing the palette here changes the whole IDE —
 * which is what the theme setting does.
 *
 * The colours are mutable `std::string`s rather than `constexpr const char*`
 * because `set_palette()` overwrites them at run time. Every existing spelling
 * still compiles — `s << ACCENT`, `s += CANVAS`, `std::string(BORDER)`,
 * `SetProperty("border-color", SELECT)` — because `Rml::String` *is*
 * `std::string`; only code assigning one to a `const char*` has to change.
 *
 * The metrics stay `constexpr`. They are laid out into a stylesheet built once,
 * and a size that changed under an already-laid-out document would move every
 * box without telling the layout.
