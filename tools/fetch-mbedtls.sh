# Fetch + build the pinned mbedTLS into vendor/ (gitignored). Run once, and
# only if you want https.
#
# This one is OPTIONAL, unlike tools/fetch-rmlui.sh. Without it every build
# still works and `net` still speaks http; what is missing is https, which then
# fails at run time with OE_ERR_UNSUPPORTED and never downgrades itself to a
# plaintext request. `libs/net/lib.json` names the archives below under
# `optional_requires`, so the presence of this directory is the whole switch.
#
# Pinned to the 3.6 long-term-support line: security fixes for years, and no
# API churn under a program that was compiled last winter.
