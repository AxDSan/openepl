/* The error slot — how a fallible command says why it failed.
 *
 * OpenEPL has no exceptions and no out-parameters, so a command that fails
 * returns a sentinel and leaves the reason here.  `last_error_code()` and
 * `last_error_text()` read it; both are zero-arity, which is exactly what makes
 * an out-parameter expressible in a language that has none.
 *
 * The conventions this file enforces are documented in abi/openepl_abi.h, next
 * to the declarations, because that is the header a library author reads.
