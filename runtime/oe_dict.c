/* Dictionaries — values found by name rather than by position.
 *
 * The keyed half of the pair arrays are the other half of.  Same ownership as
 * everything else the program holds: allocated through oe_malloc, released by
 * E_DestroyRes, carried in the slot as a pointer.
 *
 * Two allocations rather than an array's one, and that difference is the whole
 * design.  An array never grows — `append` returns a new one — so its single
 * block can be the thing the program holds.  A dictionary DOES grow in place:
 * `d["new"] = 1` has to be visible through every name that holds `d`, and a
 * name is a pointer.  So the block that moves when it grows is not the block
 * the program is holding; the header address is stable for the life of the
 * dictionary, and only the entries behind it are reallocated.
 *
 * Entries are kept in INSERTION ORDER and searched by scanning.  That makes
 * `dict_keys` answer the same order twice — which is what makes iterating one
 * reproducible, and a program's output testable — and it makes `dict_remove` a
 * memmove, exactly as removing from an array is.  The cost is a linear scan
 * per lookup; a hash index over the same entries can be added later without
 * changing a single one of the six commands, because none of them promises
 * anything about how a key is found.
